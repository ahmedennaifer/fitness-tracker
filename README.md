# fitness-tracker
## Work in progress
This is a project for learning ML deployment on azure, along with DevOps integration. 

It features a very simple random forest for calculating the fitness score of a person on certain metrics (calories, hours slept etc..).

for now, the core features are focused around : 
   - A chatgpt generated frontend.
   - A FastAPI backend for the endpoints
   - IaC with terraform
   - Alerting TBD


The services will be determined on the go.
